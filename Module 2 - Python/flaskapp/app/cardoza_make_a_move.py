#This function creates the player by grabbing the window and the x and y

#a list called body parts that has a length of 4. The next list called creature
#is used to turn the ints in body parts into yellow rectangles to make the body.
#In the for loop, it creates clones of the head, moves them 1 spot to the right,
#and attachs the rectangle to the list creature.

#while loop equaling true, there is a try-except operator that
#signifies if Q is pressed, then close the window. Also it is
#to prevent any exception errors.
